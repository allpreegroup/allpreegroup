	<br><h2> Recruit and Earn </h2> 
			
Earn R40 for every student you successfully recruit to Varsity Vibe.

How it works
Step 1 – Download the Varsity Vibe App (available on Google Play and Apple App stores) and Join.

Step 2 – Know your Ref Code: It’s the 6 digit code on your “My Profile” screen.

Step 3 – Start recruiting and earning!

How do I recruit?
Option 1:

Via your Profile icon: Go to the Menu and tap “Refer Friends”. You will be able to email your reference code to your friends OR share it via social media. When your friend opens your link, they will be directed to the “Join” page containing your Ref Code.

Option 2:

In person: Get your friend to download the App and “Join now”. Give them your Ref Code to input during step 1.

Once they have successfully signed up (using your Ref Code) & paid…you will earn R40 cash in your bank account! The best part is that there is no limit to how many friends you can sign up. So go crazy, refer your peeps, and make some cash!

Please note:

Standard Bank MyMo / Student Achiever members get a FREE Varsity Vibe membership. If you refer such a member, then you do not get a R40 referral fee. (ie if Varsity Vibe does not receive a R200 payment, we cannot pay a R40 commission/referral fee).

If you aren’t a full Varsity Vibe member yet, there are 3 options available:

1 - You complete step 3 (pay) and become a full Varsity Vibe member, in which case we pay the cash into your bank account for all your successful referrals and every other person you successfully recruit thereafter; or

2 - We accumulate the R40 for each successful referral you make until you reach R200 (5 successful recruits) and you get an automatic VV membership. All referrals thereafter will be paid direct into your bank account; or

3 - If you have are a Standard Bank MyMo / Student Achiever and need to verify your Standard Bank MyMo / Student Achiever account please email support@varsityvibe.co.za saying “My Varsity Vibe account has been verified but I want to switch to a Standard Bank VV account” and we will sort you out asap.
