  quote: I love this option as a way to get even more for my money. I simply purchase the gift card ahead of time and then make my purchases as normal. It goes a long way in helping me save money!

  quote: On February 24, 2024, was the first time I used the Allpree Gift Card at the progressive supermarket! The process was super easy, just like using my debit card to pay.

  quote: I've been using my gift card for about 11 months and reached over $115,700 in cashback, Itâ€™s safe and I highly recommend them! I intend to stay with them, I get cash for simply doing what I was going to do anyway!
